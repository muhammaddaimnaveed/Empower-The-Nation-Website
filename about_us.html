                with marketable skills and <br>drive &nbsp; socio-economic &nbsp; change.&nbsp;  Recognizing&nbsp;  the &nbsp; urgent&nbsp;  
                need &nbsp; for &nbsp; practical &nbsp; education <br>and &nbsp; training,&nbsp;  Radebe &nbsp; established Empower The 
                Nation to address the skills gap in the job market &nbsp; and &nbsp; provide &nbsp; underprivileged&nbsp; 
                communities &nbsp; with &nbsp; the&nbsp;  tools necessary to achieve <br>financial independence and 
                career growth. Her initiative has since become a beacon of hope, transforming
